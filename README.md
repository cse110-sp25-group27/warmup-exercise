# warmup-exercise

## Card info
- JavaScript cards: 1 - 10
- TypeScript cards: 11 - 20
- HTML cards: 21 - 30
- CSS cards: 31 - 40

## SWOT Analysis
- [Analysis Doc](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group27/cse110-sp25-group27/blob/main/admin/adr/SWOT_analysis.pdf)

## Goals
1. Card Deck and Playing Card Web Components complete with animation of flip and/or shuffle (HTML, CSS, and very light JS)
2. Dealing with the deck, complete with an ability to pull the cards one or multiple at a time and state management of the deck (more JS + some simple web APIs) 
3. A simple game, either Solitaire or Black Jack Game, against an algorithmic dealer.  No multiplayer effort here or network work allowed.  The dealer may have a brain-dead, random, and correct mode for fun.  If you do BlackJack you need state for money to be tracked.    (the most JS)

## Plan of Action
1. Meeting in person (hackathon style)
2. Looking at issues within repo
   - Create an issue for each part you are addressing
   - Use the templates for group you are in
   - Write a brief description and goals
   - Mark as finished once pushed
4. **FINISH PART 1**, other tasks we probably won't get to
5. Summarized in meeting notes.

## Meeting Notes
- [April 16](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group27/cse110-sp25-group27/blob/main/admin/meetings/april_16.md)
- [April 16 (TA Meeting)](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group27/cse110-sp25-group27/blob/main/admin/meetings/april_16_TA.md)
- [April 18](https://github.com/cse110-sp25-group27/cse110-sp25-group27/blob/main/admin/meetings/april_18.md)

## Instructions for reference
You may not jump steps. You have to be able to do #1 properly before #2, and so on.  Your card and deck widgets should use standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and should not use libraries or frameworks, as they aren't needed.  Components will be built using Web Components which are built-in to browsers.   State management can be handled via the localStorage API for now.   You must also use GitHub to do this.  We must see multiple pushes to your repository and some uses of issues to allocate work.

The amount of polish and presentation in the warm-up is up to you; depending on how your efforts progress, you can make it much more visual with animations or even add in sounds or voice.  Most importantly, you should focus the most on code quality and other aspects of a well-engineered piece of code.  After your mini-sprint, you demonstrate your component(s) or app in a short video uploaded on YouTube (under 3 minutes), access to the working app for your TA mentor, and a SWOT analysis of your learnings from the exercise. 

The expected outcomes of this exercise are:

    Implementation of at least one of the steps. For this create a new repository in your Github Organization called warmup-exercise. 
        NOTE: If you are attempting multiple widgets, keep them in separate folders in the repo mentioned above
    Review of the process followed by a SWOT analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat) on how it went on the aspects team, tech, and tool and a brief summary of your learning. 

For the submission on GRADESCOPE, you need to submit a pdf containing:

    Team number
    Team name
    Github Repo Link
    Youtube Link
    Full SWOT analysis

Also upload this PDF in your main GitHub repository in the directory admin/adr
