## Goals
1. Card Deck and Playing Card Web Components complete with animation of flip and/or shuffle (HTML, CSS, and very light JS)
2. Dealing with the deck, complete with an ability to pull the cards one or multiple at a time and state management of the deck (more JS + some simple web APIs) 
3. A simple game, either Solitaire or Black Jack Game, against an algorithmic dealer.  No multiplayer effort here or network work allowed.  The dealer may have a brain-dead, random, and correct mode for fun.  If you do BlackJack you need state for money to be tracked.    (the most JS)
